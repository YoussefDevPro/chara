do i started working on the permissions, but i just got brain damage and i have to write abt this to make my ideas clear, so we got a list of permissions (dont forget to open the file with all the permissions in the left/right so i dont forget what kind of permissions we have)
alr, so we have the permissions nested, but what im scared abt a bit is the guest and user presets, like, a guest can only read, but ofc he cant read everything, only the allowed stuff, so i might have to add a "is_public" for some tables wich will make everyone be able to read stuff, alr, so there is public, then a user can only be allowed to read or have some sort of permissions, that mean, i have to make a list of permissions that a user can have, a guest can have, and what an admin can have, and also a list of what an admin/owner can set as permissions for other ppl, like, an admin cant set another admin, its only the owner etc, annndd, uh, i forgot, oh yeah i think i rememeber, i have to enforce rules at the struct lvl, to make sure i will not screw up services module, and yeah uh, time to generate a todo list with this dumps lol 
# 🛡️ Workspace Permissions: Implementation Roadmap

This document serves as the source of truth for the nested bitmask permission system. 
**Goal:** Prevent brain damage by enforcing rules at the struct level and protecting the service layer.

---

## 📂 Permissions Reference (The Bits)
*Keep these values in mind when implementing presets.*

### Workspace
- `0x1`: Edit (Settings) | `0x2`: Delete (Workspace) | `0x4`: Manage Roles | `0x8`: Manage Users
- `0x10`: Export Data | `0x20`: Manage Integrations | `0x40`: View Audit Logs

### Table
- `0x1-0x8`: Records (C/E/D/V)
- `0x10-0x80`: Fields (C/E/D/V)
- `0x100-0x800`: Views (C/E/D/V)
- `0x1000`: Archive | `0x10000`: Bulk Import | `0x20000`: Lock Schema

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Struct-Level Enforcement
*These methods prevent the "Service Layer" from having to guess if an action is legal.*

- [ ] **Implement `contains_all` logic:** Ensure that checking multiple bits at once is easy (e.g., `mask.contains(Edit | Delete)`).
- [ ] **The "Hierarchy Cap":** Implement `UserPermissions::can_grant(&self, target_perms)`. 
    - *Rule:* An actor cannot give a permission bit they do not personally possess.
- [ ] **The Admin Guard:** Explicitly block `ManageRoles` and `ManageUsers` granting unless the actor has the `WorkspacePermission::Delete` (The Owner bit).

---

## 👥 Phase 2: Preset Generation
*Define the templates for different types of access.*

- [ ] **`preset_public()`**
    - Only includes `BasePermission::View` and `TablePermission::ViewRecords`.
    - To be used as a "fallback" when a Table is marked `is_public: true`.
- [ ] **`preset_guest(base_id)`**
    - Workspace: `None`.
    - Base: `View` only.
    - Table: Specific `TableId`s mapped to `ViewRecords`.
- [ ] **`preset_member()`**
    - Standard "Producer" access. Can create/edit records but cannot delete bases or manage integrations.
- [ ] **`preset_admin()`**
    - Full control over content and users, but cannot delete the workspace or demote the owner.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Service Layer Logic (The Search)
*How the application actually "looks up" permissions during a request.*



- [ ] **Top-Down Resolver:**
    - `check(Workspace) -> check(Base) -> check(Table) -> check(Record)`.
    - If any parent returns `AccessDenied`, stop execution immediately.
- [ ] **Public Override:**
    - Check `table.is_public` before checking the user's bitmask. 
    - If `true`, allow `GET` requests even if the user bitmask is empty.
- [ ] **The "Hidden Field" Filter:**
    - Create a helper: `fn filter_visible_fields(table_data, user_perms)`.
    - This should strip out columns where the user lacks the `FieldPermission::View` bit.

---

## 🧪 Phase 4: Reliability & Tests
*Ensuring the system is "Bulletproof".*

- [ ] **Test: Promotion Leak:** Verify an Admin cannot promote themselves to Owner.
- [ ] **Test: Data Leak:** Verify a user with Table access but *no* Field access sees `null` or `hidden` for that column.
- [ ] **Test: Sparse Logic:** Verify that if a `RecordId` is missing from the HashMap, it correctly inherits the `TablePermission`.

---

## 📝 Notes & Reminders
> **Note:** Use `u32` for TablePermissions to accommodate the large number of bits (Bulk, Lock, Export, etc.). 
> **Warning:** Avoid manual Hex math! Use bit-shifting (`1 << 4`) in the macro to prevent overlapping bits like `0x16`.
