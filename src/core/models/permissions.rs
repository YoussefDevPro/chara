// alr folks, im going to rewrite this
// * do nothing *
// well, i think we ACTUALLY have to rewrite this
// * plays penumbra phantasm in the bg for epicness *
// yeah no ill actually just write my ideas here * penumbra phantasm still playing *

// 5min pass

// alr so uh, instead that each thing have its own permission, what we'll do is that we have a
// role, but its diff in each base or table, (got self confused abt graphs uh, lemme read this
// again)

// so for permissions we will need
// can() user do stuff,
// change permissions,
// and presets, like, for new users what they can do, or just for guests what they can do etc
// (we give the workspace role)

// ok so instead we'll make each permissions as a relation , and bc surreal db store them as
// tables, we'll need to know how the table will be

// btw welcome to my macro insanity lol

// just realised how much insanity i put in this single file
